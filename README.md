# Geometry adaptive waveformer for modeling cardiovascular dynamics
This repository implements the Geometry-Adaptive Waveformer, a novel framework for predicting blood flow dynamics in complex cardiovascular geometries. The method addresses challenges posed by irregular anatomical domains and the dynamic nature of hemodynamic responses, combining geometric adaptation with temporal modeling.

1. Install python packages pytorch, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, einops, torch_scatter, torch_cluster, etc.

2. There are two separate folders containing data sets and implementation codes.

3. Add the data (generated data) path to load the data and use the run(Main.py) file to execute the program.
